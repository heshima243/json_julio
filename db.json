      "title": "vulnerability and effects of climate change",
      "body": "Climate change has imposed unprecedented conditions on ecosystems for millennia, to which many species do not have the time to adapt. It has disrupted seasonal events, contributed to the proliferation of diseases and invasive species, and has led to droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, and heatwaves, causing species migrations and threatening the most vulnerable ecosystems. It degrades natural habitats, which are already suffering from human activities, and threatens species such as corals and kelp (a type of seaweed). These disruptions have already resulted in massive mortality and the first climate-induced extinctions of species, as well as the loss of polar, mountainous, and equatorial ecosystems. \\\"The effects have been felt more rapidly, are more extensive, and have greater consequences than anticipated,\\\" the report states. And these phenomena are expected to worsen with future climate change.",
